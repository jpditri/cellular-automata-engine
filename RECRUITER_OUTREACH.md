### For Technical Recruiters

Dear [Recruiter Name],

I'm looking for a skilled Ruby developer for a 4-week contract project building a cellular automaton game engine. This is a well-defined project with clear deliverables and timeline.

**Project**: Open-source cellular automaton engine in Ruby
**Duration**: 4 weeks (160 hours)

**Start**: ASAP
**Location**: Remote

**Key Requirements**:
- Strong Ruby development (3+ years)
- Graphics programming experience (SDL2 preferred)
- Object-oriented design expertise
- Interest in computational simulations/games

The developer will build an engine for creating programs like Conway's Game of Life with visualization capabilities. Full technical specifications are available.

Can you help source candidates with this specific skill set? I'm particularly interested in developers who have:
- Built game engines or visualization tools in Ruby
- Worked with cellular automata or similar simulations
- Open source contributions

Please let me know if you have suitable candidates in your network.

Best regards,
[Your name]
