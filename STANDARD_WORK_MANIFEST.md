# Standard Work Manifest - Cellular Automaton Engine

## Project Deployment via Standard Work System

### Primary Standard Work Pattern: `autonomous-development-constellation`

This project will be executed through the standard work system using autonomous agent squads with IMF coordination oversight.

## Squad Deployment Commands

```bash
# Initialize project with standard work
./computer standard-work init cellular-automaton-engine \
  --pattern autonomous-development-constellation \
  --imf-oversight IMF-2024-CA-001

# Deploy grid architecture squad
./computer agent-squad deploy grid-architecture \
  --lead grid-architect-prime \
  --auto-recruit true \
  --standard-work grid-system-design-pattern

# Deploy rule engine squad  
./computer agent-squad deploy rule-engine \
  --lead rule-engine-master \
  --auto-recruit true \
  --standard-work rule-definition-workflow

# Deploy visualization squad
./computer agent-squad deploy visualization \
  --lead render-pipeline-coordinator \
  --auto-recruit true \
  --standard-work multi-renderer-pattern

# Deploy web integration squad
./computer agent-squad deploy web-integration \
  --lead isomorphic-bridge-architect \
  --tier 4 \
  --auto-recruit true \
  --standard-work isomorphic-deployment-pattern

# Monitor all squads
./computer squad-dashboard --project cellular-automaton-engine
```

## Standard Work Patterns Referenced

### 1. Grid System Design Pattern
- Mathematical modeling procedures
- Optimization workflows
- Neighbor calculation algorithms
- Performance benchmarking

### 2. Rule Definition Workflow  
- DSL specification procedures
- Parser implementation patterns
- State machine optimization
- Validation test generation

### 3. Multi-Renderer Pattern
- Renderer abstraction design
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Animation pipeline workflow
- Performance profiling

### 4. Isomorphic Deployment Pattern
- Server/client code sharing
- Transpilation procedures
- WebAssembly compilation
- Progressive enhancement

## Recruitment Authority

Each squad lead has autonomous recruitment authority to:
- Add specialized agents as needed
- Request tier upgrades for complex tasks
- Cross-recruit from other squads
- Engage consultant agents

## Coordination Mechanisms

### Inter-Squad Communication
```yaml
communication:
  protocol: event-driven-mesh
  channels:
    architecture: /squads/cellular-automaton/architecture
    implementation: /squads/cellular-automaton/implementation  
    integration: /squads/cellular-automaton/integration
    blockers: /squads/cellular-automaton/blockers-urgent
```

### IMF Oversight Touchpoints
- Architecture reviews (daily)
- Integration checkpoints (per milestone)
- Performance validations (continuous)
- Security audits (pre-deployment)

## Quality Gates (Automated)

1. **Code Quality**: RuboCop + custom rules
2. **Test Coverage**: 95% minimum
3. **Performance**: Sub-10ms operations
4. **Documentation**: 100% public API
5. **Integration**: Full compatibility tests

## Escalation Path

1. Squad-level blockers → Squad Lead
2. Inter-squad issues → IMF Coordinator  
3. Technical decisions → Architecture Board
4. Resource conflicts → IMF Resource Manager
5. Critical failures → Human oversight trigger

## Success Metrics

- **Velocity**: 200+ story points/week per squad
- **Quality**: <1% defect escape rate
- **Efficiency**: 80% first-time-success
- **Coordination**: <30min blocker resolution

## Activation

```bash
# Execute full deployment
./computer standard-work execute cellular-automaton-deployment \
  --manifest STANDARD_WORK_MANIFEST.md \
  --config AGENT_SQUAD_DEPLOYMENT.yaml \
  --start-immediate \
  --monitoring enabled
```
