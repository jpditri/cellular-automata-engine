# [ARCHIVED - IMF AGENT DEPLOYMENT ACTIVE]

## Original Human Recruitment Post (Superseded by IMF Directive)
### Position: Contract Ruby Developer (4-week project)

### Project Overview
We're seeking an experienced Ruby developer to build an open-source cellular automaton game engine. This engine will support creating programs like Conway's Game of Life, Langton's Ant, and Wolfram's elementary cellular automata with both square and hexagonal grid systems.

### Key Responsibilities
- Implement core grid system supporting square and hexagonal layouts
- Develop flexible rule engine for cellular automata state transitions
- Create visualization layer with multiple rendering options (console, SDL2, SVG)
- Build example implementations (Conway's Game of Life, Langton's Ant, Wolfram rules)
- Write comprehensive tests and documentation
- Optimize performance for large grid simulations

### Required Skills
- **Ruby expertise** (3+ years experience)
- Strong understanding of **object-oriented design patterns**
- Experience with **graphics programming** (SDL2, OpenGL, or similar)
- Knowledge of **cellular automata** and computational models
- Test-driven development with RSpec
- Git version control

### Nice to Have
- Experience with Ruby performance optimization
- Knowledge of hexagonal grid mathematics
- Game development background
- Open source contribution history
- Experience with DSL design in Ruby

### Technical Requirements
The developer will implement:
- Abstract grid system with square and hexagonal implementations
- Rule engine supporting pattern matching and state transitions
- Simulator with history tracking and reversibility
- Multiple renderer implementations
- CLI interface using Thor
- Comprehensive test suite

### Project Timeline
- **Week 1**: Core engine (grid system, rules, basic simulator)
- **Week 2**: Example programs and SDL2 visualization
- **Week 3**: Hexagonal grids, advanced features, optimizations
- **Week 4**: Polish, documentation, interactive rule editor

### Compensation
- **Rate**: $100-150/hour based on experience
- **Duration**: 4 weeks (160 hours)
- **Type**: Contract/Freelance
- **Location**: Remote

### How to Apply
Please submit:
1. Resume/CV highlighting relevant Ruby projects
2. GitHub profile or code samples
3. Brief description of any cellular automata or simulation projects
4. Your hourly rate and availability

### Bonus Points
- Show us a cellular automaton you've implemented
- Contribute a PR to an open-source Ruby graphics/game project
- Share ideas for extending the engine beyond the initial scope

## About This Project
This is an open-source project aimed at creating an educational and experimental platform for cellular automata. The final product will be released under MIT license and serve as both a learning tool and a foundation for computational art and research projects.
